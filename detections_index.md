<td>detection of a weak signal through global noise</td>
<td>Gray zone threats are challenging given that warning requires detection of a weak signal through global noise and across threat vectors and regional boundaries.Three interconnected gray zone elements characterize the nature of the activity: 
Temporality: The nature of gray zone threats truly requires a “big picture view” over long timescales and across regions and functional topics.
Attribution: requiring an “almost certain” or “nearly certain analytic assessment before acting costs time and analytic effort
Intent: judgement of adversarial intent to conduct gray zone activity. Indeed, the purpose of countering gray zone threats is to deter adversaries from fulfilling their intent to act. While attribution is one piece of the puzzle, closing the space around intent often means synthesizing multiple relevant indicators and warnings, including the state’s geopolitical ambitions, military ties, trade and investment, level of corruption, and media landscape, among others.</td>
